# Decision Tree Classifier Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a decision tree classifier using Python. It's designed to provide insights into how decision tree algorithms can be applied for classification problems in a dataset. The project uses the 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' dataset to illustrate this concept.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the project depends on several Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can run the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The notebook includes detailed steps from loading and preprocessing the data to training and testing the decision tree model.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Loading and Processing: Uses pandas to load and prepare the data.
2. Feature Scaling: Applies standard scaling to the features.
3. Model Training: Trains a decision tree classifier with specific parameters.
4. Model Testing: Tests the model on a split test dataset.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by improving the code, adding new features, or by reporting bugs. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
